**[ndsk](https://ndsk.dev)** (node ​​stack) is a full-stack framework for JavaScript developers. It is designed to be very simple, allowing you to create secure, high-performance, high-quality programs with minimal code. It has powerful routing, flexible layout modes, fast compilation speed, extensible plug-ins and middleware, and supports server-side rendering (SSR), client-side rendering (CSR), static rendering (SSG), and hybrid mode `SSCR`. It almost makes up for all the shortcomings of other frameworks, all for the purpose of improving development efficiency.

#### Main advantages:
- Safe, very simple design, powerful, ready to use, no additional configuration required
- Supports various rendering modes such as server-side rendering (SSR), CSR, SSG, SSCR, etc., with super fast loading speed and very friendly to SEO
- Automatically optimizes the package size, and the compilation speed is super fast, about 10-100 times that of other frameworks
- Supports hot updates on the server, and no need to restart the server with tools such as nodemon every time the code is modified
- Supports real-time page reload, and the page can be automatically refreshed when the front-end components and back-end routes are modified
- Supports detailed error stack tracking in development mode
- Super fast startup speed, it dynamically compiles according to page requests, without the need to compile all pages every time
- Automatic compilation, and supports ES5\ES6+
- Powerful routing function, supports dynamic routing
- Compared with other frameworks, it supports more flexible layout modes
- Use `react` `renderToPipeableStream` to render pages, and support `lazy, Suspense` asynchronous loading
- It has built-in major modules such as `mongodb`, no additional configuration is required, and it supports front-end, back-end, and full-stack development.
